    <h1>Venus and Adonis (1593)</h1>
    </section>
    <h2>By William Shakespeare</h2>
    <div id="one">
        Had ta’en his last leave of the weeping morn,<br>
        Rose-cheek’d Adonis tried him to the chase;<br>
        Hunting he lov’d, but love he laugh’d to scorn;<br>     
        Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,<br>
        And like a bold-fac’d suitor ‘gins to woo <br>
    </div>

    <div id="two">
        Thrice fairer than myself,’ thus she bega <br>
        ‘The field’s chief flower, sweet above compare, <br>      
         Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man, <br>
         More white and red than doves or roses are;<br>
         Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,<br>
         Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.   <br>
    </div>

    <div id="three">
        Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,<br>
        And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;<br>
        If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed <br>
        A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:   <br>
        Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses; <br>
        And being set, I’ll smother thee with kisses: <br>
    </div>

    <div id="four">
        ‘And yet not cloy thy lips with loath’d satiety, <br>
        But rather famish them amid their plenty,   <br>
        Making them red and pale with fresh variety;<br>
        Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:<br>
        A summer’s day will seem an hour but short,<br>
        Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.’<br>
    </div>
